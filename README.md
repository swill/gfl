# gfl

Project Naming: "Git + Confluence" -> "gitfluence" -> `gfl`

Deterministic, bidirectional synchronization between Markdown files in a Git repository and pages in an Atlassian Confluence instance.

`gfl` operates entirely through Git hooks and the Confluence REST API. It mirrors a Confluence space's hierarchy as a directory tree of Markdown files, and uses Git's native branch and merge machinery to reconcile changes from both sides.

Each managed `.md` file carries a small front-matter block recording its `confluence_page_id` and `confluence_version`. A persistent local Git branch named `confluence` always represents the last-known Confluence-side state. `gfl pull` updates that branch from Confluence and merges it into your working branch. `gfl push` diffs your working branch against `confluence`, sends the differences to Confluence, then commits a sync chore on your working branch and fast-forwards `confluence` to match. Conflicts are ordinary `git merge` conflicts, resolved with your normal tools.

Highlights:

- **Bidirectional**, driven by Git events — commits trigger pull, pushes trigger push.
- **Page identity travels with the file**. Renames, moves, and copies preserve the link to the Confluence page automatically.
- **Tree-aware**. Confluence's hierarchy mirrors a directory tree; pages with children become directories with `index.md`.
- **Deterministic conversion**. Purpose-built Go lexers; round-trips are byte-stable for every supported construct.
- **Unsupported constructs preserved verbatim** via a base64-encoded HTML-comment fence — Confluence macros, panels, mentions, etc. survive round-trips intact.
- **Conflicts are git conflicts**. Resolve them with your editor and `git merge --continue`.
- **Self-recovering on partial push failure**. Operations that fail simply re-appear in the next push's diff.
- **No external dependencies** beyond Git and the binary itself — no CI, no Pandoc, no LLMs.

## Installation

`gfl` is installed per-developer, not bundled with consuming repositories. Each developer puts the binary on their `PATH`.

### From release binaries

Pre-compiled binaries are published as GitHub release artifacts for `linux/amd64`, `darwin/amd64`, `darwin/arm64`, and `windows/amd64`. Download the appropriate archive, extract, and place `gfl` somewhere on your `PATH` (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`).

Verify the install:

```sh
gfl version
```

### From source

Requires Go 1.22 or later.

```sh
go install github.com/swill/gfl@latest
```

This drops the binary in `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`. Make sure that directory is on your `PATH`.

## Getting started: a new repository

Use `gfl init` to initialise a Git repository from an existing Confluence page tree.

```sh
cd your-repo

# Create .env with Confluence credentials
cat > .env <<'EOF'
CONFLUENCE_BASE_URL=https://yourorg.atlassian.net/wiki
CONFLUENCE_USER=your.email@yourorg.com
CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
EOF

# Populate the repository from a Confluence page tree
gfl init --page-id <root-page-id> [--local-root docs/]
```

`init` fetches the full page tree, converts each page to Markdown (with front-matter), downloads attachments, and writes:

- `docs/` (or your chosen `--local-root`) — the Markdown file tree
- `.gfl.json` — configuration (root page ID, cached space key, local root, attachments dir)
- `.gitignore` entries for `.env`
- `.gfl/hooks/` shims, installed into `.git/hooks/`

Review the output, then `git add` and commit. Your first post-commit hook will seed the local `confluence` branch from your tree state.

### What gets written

Given a Confluence tree:

```
Root Page
  ├── Architecture
  │     ├── Database Design
  │     └── API Design
  ├── Onboarding
  │     ├── For Developers
  │     └── For Managers
  └── API Reference
```

The local tree:

```
docs/
  index.md                            # Root Page
  _attachments/                       # page-tree-mirrored attachments
    architecture/
      database-design/
        schema.png
  architecture/
    index.md                          # has children → directory
    database-design.md
    api-design.md
  onboarding/
    index.md
    for-developers.md
    for-managers.md
  api-reference.md                    # leaf → flat file
```

Each `.md` file starts with front-matter:

```markdown
---
confluence_page_id: "5233836047"
confluence_version: 12
---

# Page Title

...
```

Conventions:

- Pages with children become directories containing `index.md`; leaf pages are flat `.md` files.
- Filenames are deterministically slugified from page titles.
- Attachments live under `_attachments/` mirroring the page hierarchy.
- Front-matter is canonicalised on every pull (sorted keys, double-quoted strings) so byte-stable round-trips are preserved.

### Configuration files

`.gfl.json` (tracked):

```json
{
  "confluence_root_page_id": "123456789",
  "confluence_space_key": "DOCS",
  "local_root": "docs/",
  "attachments_dir": "docs/_attachments"
}
```

`.env` (gitignored):

```
CONFLUENCE_BASE_URL=https://yourorg.atlassian.net/wiki
CONFLUENCE_USER=your.email@yourorg.com
CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
```

Environment variables of the same names take precedence over `.env`.

## Getting started: an existing gfl repository

When joining a repository someone else has already run `gfl init` on:

```sh
git clone <repo>
cd <repo>

# Set up credentials
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Confluence credentials

# Install Git hooks (assumes `gfl` is on your PATH)
gfl install
```

`install` is idempotent; it just copies hook shims from `.gfl/hooks/` into `.git/hooks/`.

After this, ordinary Git operations stay in sync with Confluence:

- `git commit` → post-commit hook runs `gfl pull`
- `git push` → pre-push hook runs `gfl push`
- `git merge` / `git rebase` → post-merge / post-rewrite hooks also run pull

The pull hooks are guarded by `GFL_HOOK_ACTIVE` so the commit that pull itself creates doesn't re-trigger pull. Push self-suppresses the same hooks while it commits its own sync chore.

### Daily commands

| Command       | What it does                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gfl status`  | Show files that differ between the working branch and `confluence` — exactly what `push` would attempt.                                                 |
| `gfl pull`    | Sync Confluence into the `confluence` branch and merge it into the working branch. Conflicts surface as standard merge conflicts.                       |
| `gfl push`    | Diff against the `confluence` branch and write changes to Confluence; commit a sync chore on the working branch and fast-forward `confluence` to match. |
| `gfl version` | Print version, commit, and build date.                                                                                                                  |

You usually don't run `pull` or `push` directly — Git hooks handle them. Use `status` to see what's pending; use the explicit commands when troubleshooting.

### How sync works

The local branch `confluence` is the canonical "last-known Confluence state" — every file there carries `confluence_page_id` and `confluence_version` in front-matter. It's machine-managed; don't commit to it directly.

**Pull** (post-commit / post-merge / post-rewrite):

1. Fetches the Confluence page tree.
2. On the `confluence` branch, applies any creates / updates / renames / deletes (deletes confirmed via direct `GET` → 404) and downloads attachments.
3. Commits as `chore(sync): confluence @ <ts>`.
4. Switches back to the working branch and runs `git merge confluence`.

**Push** (pre-push):

1. Diffs the working branch against `confluence` with rename detection.
2. For each changed `.md`: creates, updates (with 409 retry), deletes, or renames the corresponding Confluence page (renames apply the Title Stability Rule to avoid capitalisation drift).
3. Round-trips each pushed body through `CfToMd` so its committed form matches what a future pull would produce.
4. Commits `chore(sync): confluence-push @ <ts>` on the working branch and fast-forwards `confluence` to that commit. After a successful push, `confluence` and the working branch tip are byte-equal.

Failed operations don't queue — they re-appear in the next push's diff and are retried then.

## Developing gfl

This section is for working on `gfl` itself, not for using it.

### Build

```sh
go build -o gfl .
```

Or with version metadata:

```sh
make build
```

### Test

```sh
go test ./...
```

Tests use real temporary Git repositories (`gitutil/`, `cmd/`) and `httptest.NewServer` (`api/`). The `cmd/` package also includes end-to-end scenario tests against an in-memory mock Confluence (`cmd/e2e_mock_test.go`). No external services required.

### Project structure

```
main.go      Entry point
cmd/         CLI commands (Cobra): init, install, push, pull, status, version
lexer/       Pure text transforms: normalise, frontmatter, cf_to_md, md_to_cf, fence, slugify
api/         Confluence REST v1 client (content, attachments)
gitutil/     Git primitives: branch, diff, merge, stash, mv/rm, content-at-ref
tree/        CfTree/CfNode, PathMap (slug-based path computation), AttachmentDir
config/      .gfl.json and .env credential loading
```

See `CLAUDE.md` for the design rationale, sync invariants, and the round-trip idempotency contract that the lexers must satisfy.

### Releases

Release binaries are built via the `Makefile` `release` target and published as GitHub release artifacts.
